# AI_Fairness

We examined the performance of five machine learning models when performing four-category classification of survival outcomes across age, sex, and race subgroups using TCGA data of colorectal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. This repository includes sample code for evaluating model performance across these subgroups used in Feng et al. Towards machine learning fairness in classifying multicategory causes of deaths in colorectal or lung cancer patients.
